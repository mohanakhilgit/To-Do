Simple Todo Application
A full-stack Todo application built with a Django REST Framework backend and a modern React frontend. This application allows users to register, log in, and perform complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their tasks.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **CRUD Operations:** Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for todos.
- **Modern Frontend:** A responsive and interactive user interface built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Client-Side State Management:** Global state for authentication managed with React Context.
- **Robust API Handling:** Automatic token refresh, graceful error handling, and debounced search.
- **Client-Side Functionality:** Includes search, pagination, and a date picker for due dates.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, Simple JWT
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router DOM
- **Database:** SQLite3 (default for development)

## Backend Setup
Follow these steps to get the Django backend up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine.
```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>/backend  # Navigate to the backend folder
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```sh
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Migrations
Apply the database migrations to create your database schema.
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Start the Server
Run the Django development server.
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
The backend API will now be running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Frontend Setup
Follow these steps to get the React frontend up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### 1. Navigate to Frontend Directory
From the root of the project, navigate into the frontend folder.
```sh
cd <your-project-directory>/frontend # Or whatever you named it, e.g., todo-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all the required npm packages.
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the root of the frontend directory. This file will hold the URL for your backend API.
```env
# frontend/.env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

### 4. Start the React Frontend
Run the Vite development server.
```sh
npm run dev
```
The React application will now be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (or another port if 3000 is busy).

## Environment Variables
This project requires the following environment variables to be set.

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
The Django backend does not require a .env file for this basic setup, but it relies on a `SECRET_KEY`. For development, the one generated by `django-admin startproject` is sufficient. For production, this should be moved to an environment variable.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)
Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for your Django backend API.

**Example `frontend/.env` file:**
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```
